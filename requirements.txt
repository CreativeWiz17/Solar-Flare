# Solar Flare Radiation Impact Predictor - Required Python Packages
# 
# What each package does:
# - numpy: Fast math calculations (integrating flare energy)
# - matplotlib: Creating scientific graphs and visualizations  
# - scipy: Advanced scientific calculations (finding flare peaks)
# - sunpy: Downloads real solar data from GOES satellites
# - pandas: Organizing and managing data tables
# - astropy: Astronomy calculations and unit conversions
#
# Install all at once with: pip install -r requirements.txt

numpy>=1.21.0
